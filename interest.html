        <h2>Jogging</h2>
        <p> I like to jog because it helps me decompress and stay in shape. I get to start my day full of energy and positivity thanks to it. As I run, I enjoy the sensation of the clean air and the cadence of my footsteps. I only go brisk walking or running when I have free time. I go out with my friends occasionally and alone other times.  In addition, regular jogging helps students maintain a healthy weight, strengthen their cardiovascular systems, and increase their endurance, all of which will benefit my physical health. Because jogging promotes the release of endorphins, which can lessen stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, it also improves mental health. It also elevates mood in general.

        <h2>Listening Music</h2>
        <p> Music listening is one of my favorite hobbies. I like discovering new musicians and genres, and it helps me de-stress. I can't go a day without music, whether I'm studying, working out, or just relaxing at college. It can make me feel better and take me to new places and feelings. It additionally enhances general emotional well-being and lessens depressive symptoms. I adore listening to music 1990s from Malaysian bands, like Spider, Ukays, Spin, Spring, and so forth. Most of the time, I listen to music while jogging or working on notes.

        <h2>Watching Movie</h2>
        <p> I really enjoy watching movies, especially those in the action and thriller genres since they are so exciting and thrilling. I'm constantly on the edge of my seat because of the gripping scenes, quick-witted narratives, and intense sequences. Action and thriller films can provide audiences with an adrenaline rush due to their fast-paced scenes and high stakes, which can be thrilling and energizing. Seeing a movie with loved ones can improve bonds and foster the making of memories and shared experiences. What matters is that movies contribute to the enhancement of educational value. Documentaries and biographical films, for example, can offer insightful knowledge and insights on a variety of subjects, improving your awareness and learning. My favorite kind of movies are action ones because they are so entertaining and provide a means of escape.
